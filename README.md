## Features
* Play physical Game Boy / Color / Advance cartridges
* Load and play ROM files from a microSD card (with built-in support for rumble, clock, accelerometer, gyroscope)
* Multiplayer link cable functionality
* Custom, from-scratch Game Boy and Game Boy Advance FPGA cores with great game compatibility
* 14+ hour battery life 
* Video output to TV or monitor via custom dock
* Extensible hardware, designed for future improvements

## Building

Building a Retrograde handheld requires manufacturing PCBs, 3D printing the shell and buttons, and assembling components from a variety of sources. For information on manufacturing and assembling your own, see [docs/building.md](docs/building.md).

## Architecture

For an in-depth description of the project architecture, see [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

The Game Bub handheld consists of a Xilinx XC7A100T FPGA to do the main emulation and I/O, and an ESP32-S3 microcontroller to do auxiliary tasks (configuring the FPGA, rendering the UI, loading ROM files from a microSD card and sending it to the FPGA).

* `pcb`: PCB design files for Handheld, Dock, and others
* `3d`: STLs for 3D printed shell and buttons
* `fpga`: FPGA source code (HDL), written in [Chisel](https://github.com/chipsalliance/chisel)
* `firmware/handheld`: Microcontroller firmware
